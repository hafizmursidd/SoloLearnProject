1.) Remember, abstract method declarations are only permitted in abstract classes. 
	Members marked as abstract, or included in an abstract class, must be implemented by classes that derive from the abstract class. 
	An abstract class can have multiple abstract members.

2.) Abstract classes have the following features:

	- An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
	- An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.
	- A non-abstract class derived from an abstract class must include actual implementations of all inherited abstract methods and accessors.

3.) An abstract class is intended to be a base class of other classes. It acts like a template for its derived classes.
